Create the enviroments
-----------------------
conda create -p parent python=3.10 pip
conda create -p child

conda run -p parent python -m venv --without-pip --system-site-packages ./child

Activate the enviroments
------------------------
conda activate parent
conda activate --stack child


/Users/jhelmus/mc/envs/parent/lib/python3.10/site-packages
/Users/jhelmus/mc/envs/child/lib/python3.10/site-packages

ln -s /Users/jhelmus/play/child_conda_envs/conda-child-stuff.pth conda-child-stuff.pth


Questions
--------
What directory does pip install into?
    sysconfig.get_paths("posix_prefix")

Can we use site's venv support to layer?
    Perhaps but synlinks to the parent python{3,3.x} are needed along with a
    pyvenv.cfg file. Maybe also pip{3,310} files and other entrypoints?


Where in site.py are .pth file processed?
Does conda provide install hooks we can use? 
    Is the dependency graph accessible?


ToDo's

Ideas

Child enviroments should contain a link to conda-meta which refers to the
parent env.  Conda loads the prefix data from that enviroment but marks the
packages as unmanagable/frozen.

Without this conda will remove all packages in site-packages on load because
the files do not exist
