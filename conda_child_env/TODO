Add conda child subcommand to conda directly or as a plugin.

Add a new "from_parent_environment" package type that cannot be removed or updated in conda.

Used this type rather than "virtual_system" in the conda-meta.

Either:
    Read the conda-meta from the parent environment and modify the fields when read.

    Write the modified conda-meta from the parent enviroment into the child and
    write an appropriate entry in history.

Check before performing the python environment linking to check that python is
installed.

Manually create python link rather than using python -m venv

Create an conda-meta entry for the symlinked python{3,3.X} files $CHILD/bin as
well as pyvenv.cfg

Hook into conda so that conda install ... installs the dependency tree into the
child environment while trucating the tree at python. This might not be necessay
if the ideas below work.

Create symlinks in $CHILD/lib to allow dynamic library loading via rpath?

Create symlinks for non-python executables in $CHILD/bin?

Do prefix replacement on Python scripts in $CHILD/bin so that $CHILD/bin/python
is useded.

Figure out if any of this works on Windows.
